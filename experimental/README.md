# Introduction to Experimental
These are experiments that you are working on that aren't quite ready to be shared with others.
Please create a folder for yourself within here to contain your experimental code.

## Keep it Small
Same rules apply to the rest of the repo, don't check in large files even though that might be the quickest and easiest thing to do.

## Code reviews
Although not mandatory, you should think about getting code reviews for your work in experimental.
